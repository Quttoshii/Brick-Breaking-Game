# Brick-Breaking-Game
A classic brick-breaking arcade game developed using assembly language. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen, moving it left and right to bounce a ball towards a formation of bricks. The objective is to break all the bricks by striking them with the ball, which bounces off the paddle, walls, and bricks.
